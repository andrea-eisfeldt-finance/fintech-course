# Case Assignment Guidelines

## Format

- **Length:** 3–5 pages plus exhibits (7 pages plus exhibits maximum)
- **Structure:** Answer the posted case questions directly. There is no need to package your submission as a memo, report, or executive summary.
- **Exhibits:** Use exhibits for charts, tables, financial data, and supporting quantitative analysis. Exhibits do not count toward the page limit.

## Groups and Due Dates

- Cases are assigned to **Group A** or **Group B** (assigned by program: MBA, FEMBA, EMBA). See the [Syllabus]({% link syllabus.md %}) for the full schedule.
- Case writeups are due on the date of the class discussion for your group.
- Case questions are posted on the course site the week prior to the due date.

## Quantitative Analysis Required

Every case writeup must include quantitative data analysis. This means:
- Use the case exhibits and any supplementary data provided
- Pull current data from public sources to update and extend the case analysis (see suggestions in each week's case questions)
- Show your work — include charts or tables in your exhibits

## Using AI Tools

You are encouraged to use AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.) to deepen your analysis. Specifically:

- **Data gathering and analysis:** Use AI to pull data from public sources (SEC EDGAR, FRED, FDIC, company filings), clean and analyze datasets, and create visualizations
- **Financial modeling:** Use AI to build or check financial calculations, run scenario analyses, and verify internal consistency of your numbers
- **Research:** Use AI to find recent news, regulatory developments, and academic papers relevant to your case
- **Editing:** Use AI to distill your arguments, cut unnecessary text, and sharpen your writing

**Important:** AI should make your analysis *deeper and more quantitative*, not shorter or more generic. Always verify AI-generated facts and data against primary sources. Cite all sources.

## Grading (30% of course grade for 2 group cases; 15% for individual case)

Strong case writeups will demonstrate:
- **Quantitative rigor** — analysis grounded in data, not unsupported assertions
- **Application of course concepts** — connect your analysis to frameworks from lectures and readings (market vs. book value, cost structure, frictions, business model economics)
- **Current awareness** — update the case with what has happened since it was written, using recent filings, news, and data
- **Clear, concise communication** — direct answers with well-labeled exhibits

## Case Pack

All cases are available through the [FinTech Case Pack](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/1387361).
