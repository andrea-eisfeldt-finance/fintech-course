*SoFi (Social Finance) launched in 2011 as a student loan refinancer leveraging alumni networks, then expanded into personal loans, mortgages, investing, and banking. The company obtained a national bank charter in 2022 and went public via SPAC. This case examines the reintermediation strategy of a fintech that evolved from disrupting banks to becoming one.*

## Case Questions

See the [Case Assignment Guidelines]({% link case-guidelines.md %}) for format and grading details.

1. Construct SoFi's corporate accounting (book value) and market value T-accounts (A=L+E and A=D+E) using the most recent 10-K filing. What is SoFi's current market-to-book ratio, and what does it imply about the market's view of SoFi's intangible assets?

2. Break down SoFi's revenue by segment — Lending, Financial Services (Relay, Invest), and Technology Platform (Galileo, Technisys) — using the most recent quarterly earnings. How has the revenue mix shifted since SoFi obtained its national bank charter in January 2022? What does the trajectory suggest about SoFi's strategic direction?

3. What are SoFi's main fixed and variable costs? Which are course-of-business expenses and which are investments in intangible assets (technology, brand, customer acquisition)? Quantify how SoFi's cost of funds changed after switching from warehouse lines and securitization to deposit funding.

4. The consumer lending landscape has changed dramatically since SoFi's founding. How do newer models — buy now, pay later (Affirm, Klarna), earned wage access (EarnIn, DailyPay), embedded lending (Shopify Capital, Apple Pay Later), and AI-native underwriting (Upstart) — compare to SoFi's approach? What frictions does each model address, and where does SoFi have advantages or disadvantages?

5. What happened to student loans during and after Covid? Analyze the impact of the federal payment pause (March 2020 – October 2023) and ongoing policy debates on SoFi's refinancing volumes. Using NY Fed Household Debt and Credit data, quantify how student loan delinquency and origination trends have evolved from 2020 to present.

6. SoFi's Galileo platform provides API-based financial infrastructure to other fintechs and banks. Analyze SoFi's "platform" strategy — is SoFi becoming more like a technology company or a bank? Using publicly available data, compare SoFi's valuation multiples (P/E, P/B) to both bank peers (e.g., Ally, Discover) and fintech peers (e.g., Upstart, LendingClub). What explains the differences?

7. How can SoFi (or a competitor) use Generative AI, machine learning, or NLP to advance its business? Be specific: identify at least one application on the revenue side (e.g., personalized product recommendations, AI-driven underwriting with alternative data), one on the cost side (e.g., automated compliance, AI customer service), and one on the balance sheet (e.g., credit risk modeling, portfolio optimization).

8. Using SoFi's public filings and NY Fed data, create a visualization of student loan origination, delinquency, and refinancing trends from 2018 to present. What does this data tell you about the refinancing opportunity going forward? Use Claude or another AI tool to pull and chart this data.

9. How could SoFi (or a competitor) utilize blockchain or stablecoin technologies to advance its business? Consider specific examples that have been tried or announced:
   - **Figure Technologies** (founded by SoFi co-founder Mike Cagney) uses its proprietary Provenance blockchain to originate HELOCs in ~10 days vs. 40+ for traditional lenders, and has filed for a ~$4B IPO. How does on-chain origination reduce costs and settlement times?
   - **SoFi launched crypto trading** in November 2025 as the first nationally chartered bank to offer direct buy/sell/hold of crypto within a banking app. In December 2025, SoFi announced its own stablecoin (SoFiUSD) with plans to integrate it into SoFi Pay for payments and settlement. What are the strategic advantages of a bank-issued stablecoin vs. third-party stablecoins (USDC, USDT)?
   - **Loan tokenization:** Figure has tokenized over $10B in loans on the Provenance blockchain; SoFi's roadmap includes loan tokenization by 2027. How could tokenized consumer loans improve liquidity, reduce securitization costs, or expand the investor base?
   - What are the regulatory risks and advantages of being a chartered bank pursuing these strategies vs. a non-bank like Figure?
