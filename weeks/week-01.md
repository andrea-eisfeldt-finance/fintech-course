## Case Questions

See the [Case Assignment Guidelines]({{ '/case-guidelines.html' | relative_url }}) for format and grading details.

1. What are large **global** banks and **universal** banks, and how do these concepts differ? *A global bank operates across multiple countries and jurisdictions; a universal bank combines commercial banking (deposits, lending) with investment banking (underwriting, trading, advisory) under one roof. JPMorgan Chase is both.* What are their sources of revenue, including both interest income and non-interest income? Using JPMorgan Chase's most recent annual report, quantify the breakdown across major business segments.

2. What are the main costs? How has JPM's efficiency ratio evolved over the past decade, and how does it compare to peer universal banks?

3. Construct JPMorgan's **corporate accounting balance sheet** (Book Assets = Book Liabilities + Book Equity). What are the main assets and liabilities? *The accounting balance sheet records items at historical cost or amortized value per GAAP — loans at face value less reserves, securities at amortized cost or fair value, deposits and borrowings at face value. Book equity is the residual and reflects accumulated retained earnings, not what the market thinks the firm is worth.*

4. Construct JPMorgan's **market value balance sheet** (Market Asset Value = Market Value of Equity + Market Value of Debt). What are the main assets and liabilities? *The market value balance sheet revalues everything at current market prices. This captures intangible assets GAAP ignores — brand, customer relationships, proprietary technology, human capital, and franchise value. Market equity is measured by market capitalization; the market-to-book ratio measures how much value the market attributes to intangibles beyond the accounting balance sheet.*

5. How has banking regulation for large banks evolved since the financial crisis, and how have subsequent shocks — the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2023 regional bank failures (SVB, Signature, First Republic), and the rise of fintech — further shaped the regulatory landscape? How do these changes affect the decision regarding scope for banks like JPM?

6. Discuss the competitive environment surrounding JPMorgan Chase. Consider pressure not only from peer universal banks but also from fintech platforms, neobanks, and big tech (Apple, Google) entering financial services. Based on the case exhibits and the most recent annual report, assess JPMorgan's market position, strengths, and weaknesses relative to both traditional and non-traditional competitors.

7. What opportunities for FinTech remain given the span of JPM and the other very large banks? How can FinTech firms compete in terms of revenue, costs, asset values, or funding advantages? Where have fintech challengers gained the most traction, and where have incumbents successfully defended their position?

8. JPMorgan invests over $17B annually in technology. Analyze JPM's AI and technology strategy — including its proprietary LLM initiatives, big data and alternative data capabilities, payments infrastructure (Onyx, JPM Coin), and data analytics. Is JPM better positioned to adopt AI than fintech startups? Why or why not? How does JPM's data advantage (hundreds of millions of customer relationships) compare to the agility advantage of smaller firms?

9. Using publicly available data (FRED, FDIC BankFind, SEC filings), compare JPMorgan's market-to-book ratio to the banking industry average over the past 10 years. What does this tell you about the market's view of JPM's franchise value? Use Claude or another AI tool to pull and visualize this data.

10. Looking ahead, what kind of strategy will maximize value for JPMorgan — continued expansion of scope, or selective focus? Consider how the competitive threats have evolved from primarily other banks (post-GFC) to include fintech, big tech, AI-native firms, and stablecoin/crypto infrastructure. Were JPM's recent years of success due to luck, good strategy, or structural advantages that may not persist?
