# Week 3 — April 21: Small Business Lending & OnDeck

**Topic:** Small business lending, alternative data, credit scoring, marketplace lending, fintech securitization

## Case

**OnDeck Capital, Inc.** — [FinTech Case Pack](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/1387361)

*OnDeck Capital pioneered online small business lending using proprietary credit scoring (the OnDeck Score) based on alternative data. The case examines the economics of marketplace lending, underwriting with non-traditional data, and the challenges of fintech securitization. OnDeck was acquired by Enova International in 2020 for ~$90M — a fraction of its peak valuation — making this a case about both innovation and the limits of the marketplace lending model.*

## Case Questions

See the [Case Assignment Guidelines]({% link case-guidelines.md %}) for format and grading details.

1. Describe OnDeck's business model. What does OnDeck do, and in what ways is it similar to or different from a bank? Construct OnDeck's book value balance sheet and identify the key assets, liabilities, and sources of equity. How does OnDeck's balance sheet compare to a traditional community bank that also lends to small businesses?

2. Why is OnDeck offering this product and traditional banks are not? What specific frictions in small business lending (information asymmetry, fixed underwriting costs, loan size economics) does OnDeck's technology address? Quantify the cost-to-originate a small business loan at a traditional bank vs. OnDeck.

3. Discuss OnDeck's credit modeling approach. How does OnDeck use alternative data and proprietary scoring (the OnDeck Score) to underwrite loans? What types of data predict small business default — distinguish between exogenous shocks, endogenous borrower decisions, and novel signals that big data, machine learning, and NLP can identify.

4. How is OnDeck funding small business loans? Analyze the evolution of OnDeck's funding strategy — equity, warehouse lines, securitization, whole loan sales, and the ODX platform. What are the risks and costs of each? Why does funding strategy matter more for fintech lenders than for deposit-funded banks?

5. Using the provided data on OnDeck's historical income statements and balance sheet, analyze the evolution of OnDeck's performance and risk profile. Why did OnDeck struggle with profitability? Identify the specific line items driving losses.

6. OnDeck was acquired by Enova International in October 2020 for approximately $90M — a fraction of its peak valuation. Kabbage was acquired by American Express around the same time. What drove these outcomes? What does this tell you about the sustainability of marketplace lending business models during credit downturns?

7. The small business fintech lending landscape has evolved significantly since the case. Compare OnDeck's original model to current approaches: embedded B2B lending (Shopify Capital, Square Loans/Block), AI-native underwriting (Bluevine, Fundbox), revenue-based financing, and bank-fintech partnerships (e.g., FinWise Bank as origination partner). Which models have proven more durable and why? What role does access to transaction data (payments, accounting software, e-commerce) play?

8. 74% of small businesses now bypass traditional banks for capital. Using FDIC and Federal Reserve Small Business Credit Survey data, quantify the small business lending gap — how much demand goes unmet, and which segments (by size, industry, geography, demographics) are most underserved? Use Claude or another AI tool to pull and visualize this data.

9. How can companies like OnDeck use Generative AI, NLP, and machine learning to grow revenue, cut costs, and improve their balance sheet? Be specific: how could an AI system analyze a small business's bank statements, tax returns, and online presence to make a credit decision in minutes? What are the risks of algorithmic lending (bias, model fragility, adverse selection)?

10. If you were to launch a new online lender for small businesses today, how would it differ from OnDeck? Consider funding model, data sources, underwriting approach, distribution strategy (direct vs. embedded), and regulatory structure (bank charter vs. non-bank). What would you do differently given what we've learned from OnDeck, Kabbage, and the current landscape?
