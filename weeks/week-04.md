# Week 4 — April 28: Robo-Advisory & Wealthfront

**Topic:** Robo-advisory, algorithmic portfolio management, democratization of investing, intangible assets

## Case

**The Wealthfront Generation** — [FinTech Case Pack](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/import/1387361)

*Wealthfront launched in 2011 as one of the first automated investment advisors ("robo-advisors"), offering tax-loss harvesting and low-cost diversified portfolios. Nearly acquired by UBS for $1.4B in 2022 (deal called off), Wealthfront filed for IPO (WLTH, Nasdaq). This case examines the democratization of wealth management and whether algorithm-driven advice can compete with traditional financial advisors.*

## Case Questions

See the [Case Assignment Guidelines]({{ '/case-guidelines.html' | relative_url }}) for format and grading details.

1. What is Wealthfront's value proposition to its investor clients? How does Wealthfront help individual investors?
   - What asset classes do they offer?
   - Why (or why not) go beyond a US-focused 60/40 portfolio?
   - Why are ETFs (and/or mutual funds) a financial innovation that is key to Wealthfront's offering?

2. How does Wealthfront build portfolios for its investors?
   - Discuss the main quantitative investment strategy factors (size, value, momentum, low volatility). How were these factors determined? (See the Wealthfront Investment Methodology White Paper.)
   - Discuss portfolio rebalancing. How would portfolios look if they started out as globally balanced in 2009 and were never rebalanced?

3. Taxes are an important component of personal investing. How do personal taxes impact investment returns? How does Wealthfront help investors minimize the impact of taxes?
   - Tax management at the account level (retirement vs. non-retirement)
   - Stock-level tax-loss harvesting — how does it work and how much value does it add? Quantify the after-tax alpha from tax-loss harvesting using Wealthfront's published data.

4. Discuss the effect of behavioral biases on individual investors' portfolio allocations and outcomes. Does Wealthfront help to offset these biases, or does it take advantage of them?

5. Analyze Wealthfront's fee structure (0.25% advisory fee, no trading commissions) in the context of the full competitive landscape. Compare to: traditional advisors (~1% AUM), other robo-advisors (Betterment, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios — 0% fee but cash drag), direct indexing platforms (Parametric, Aperio/BlackRock), and zero-commission brokerages (Robinhood, Fidelity). What is the total cost of each approach including expense ratios, cash allocation, tax efficiency, and behavioral coaching value?

6. Wealthfront was acquired by UBS in 2022 for approximately $1.4B (later called off, then Wealthfront remained independent and filed for IPO as WLTH on Nasdaq). What does this trajectory — from startup to near-acquisition by a global bank to IPO — tell you about the robo-advisory business model? Using publicly available data, what are Wealthfront's current AUM, member count, revenue, and path to profitability? How do these compare to Betterment?

7. What are the main risks to Wealthfront and how can they mitigate these risks? Consider: a prolonged market downturn (AUM-based fees decline with market), rising interest rates shifting assets to cash/bonds, regulatory risk (fiduciary standard, SEC oversight), and competitive risk from incumbents adding digital tools.

8. The wealth management industry is being reshaped by several concurrent forces. How do the following developments affect Wealthfront's competitive position?
   - **Direct indexing** — separately managed accounts that replicate indices at the individual stock level for personalized tax-loss harvesting. Wealthfront now offers this. How does it change the value proposition vs. ETF-based portfolios?
   - **AI-powered financial advice** — firms like Betterment and newer entrants are using LLMs for conversational financial planning. Can AI replicate (or surpass) the behavioral coaching that human advisors provide?
   - **Passive investing dominance** — passive funds now hold >50% of U.S. equity AUM. What are the implications for robo-advisors that are fundamentally passive allocation tools? Does the Eisfeldt, Kim & Papanikolaou "Intangible Value" thesis suggest passive indices are mispriced?

9. Using publicly available data (Wealthfront S-1/prospectus, SEC filings, industry reports), analyze the unit economics of a robo-advisory client. What is the average AUM per client, annual revenue per client, cost to acquire and serve a client, and implied lifetime value? At what scale does the business become profitable? Use Claude or another AI tool to model this.

10. Suppose there was a wealth management fintech that specialized in exploiting consumer biases rather than correcting them. What products would they offer, to which demographics, and how would they market them? Could they be profitable long-run or would competition erode margins? How would a regulator recognize such firms, and how could they deploy limited resources to best help affected consumers?
