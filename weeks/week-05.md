## Case Questions

See the [Case Assignment Guidelines]({% link case-guidelines.md %}) for format and grading details.

**The 10 institution types to identify:**
- Global banking entity with commercial bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries
- Global investment bank
- Fintech consumer lender
- Fintech small business lender
- Community bank
- Federal Reserve
- Credit card issuer
- Global insurance company
- Regional bank
- Mortgage finance company

1. For each column (A–J), identify which type of financial institution it represents. Explain your reasoning for each identification, citing the specific financial ratios that were most diagnostic. Which ratios were most useful for distinguishing between institution types, and which were ambiguous?

2. For each institution type, describe the key features of its balance sheet that make it identifiable:
   - What are the primary assets, and why?
   - What are the primary funding sources (deposits, borrowed money, repos, equity), and what does this tell you about the institution's business model and regulatory status?
   - How does equity capital as a percentage of total assets vary across institution types, and what drives those differences?

3. Compare the two fintech lenders (consumer and small business) to the traditional banks (community, regional, global). What are the most striking differences in balance sheet structure and income composition? What do these differences tell you about how fintech lenders fund themselves, the risks they bear, and why their business models may be more or less fragile than traditional banks?

4. The loan composition data (real estate, commercial & industrial, consumer) reveals the specialization of each institution. For the institutions with concentrated loan portfolios, what are the implications for diversification, credit risk, and sensitivity to specific economic shocks? How would each perform in (a) a housing downturn, (b) a consumer credit crisis, and (c) a recession concentrated in small businesses?

5. Examine the income statement ratios — interest income as a percentage of total income, and net interest margin. Why does interest income range from 6.3% of total income for one institution to 99.2% for another? What does this tell you about each institution's revenue model and reliance on fee income vs. spread income?

6. The case data is from FR Y-9C filings (Federal Reserve consolidated financial statements). Using FRED, FDIC BankFind, or SEC EDGAR, pull current balance sheet ratios for one institution in each category (e.g., JPMorgan for global banking entity, SoFi for fintech consumer lender, OnDeck/Enova for fintech small business lender). How have the ratios changed since the case data was compiled? What drove the changes — regulation, competition, interest rates, technology, or business model evolution?

7. The case includes two fintech lenders but was compiled before several major developments: SoFi obtaining a bank charter (2022), OnDeck's acquisition by Enova (2020), and the rise of embedded lending platforms (Shopify Capital, Block). If this case were updated today, would the fintech lenders' columns look more like the traditional banks, or more different? What new institution types might you add (e.g., neobank, BNPL platform, crypto exchange, robo-advisor)?
