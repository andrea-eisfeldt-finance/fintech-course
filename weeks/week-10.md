# Week 10 — June 9: Business Proposal Presentations (Group B)

**Topic:** Group B presents their fintech business proposals.

## Presentation Format

- **Time:** Each group presents for approximately 15 minutes, followed by 10 minutes of Q&A and feedback
- **Slides:** 10 slides maximum (5–7 expected), plus title slide and financial statements
- **Audience:** All students participate in Q&A and provide peer feedback

## What to Present

Your presentation should cover all three parts of your Business Proposal:

1. **The Missing Market** — What specific, unmet need in financial services does your venture address?
2. **Competitive Analysis** — How does your venture position itself relative to incumbents and other fintech challengers?
3. **Business Plan** — Product, go-to-market strategy, technology, regulatory approach, and timeline
4. **Pro Formas and Financing** — 3-year projected financials and capital requirements

See the full [Business Proposal Assignment]({{ '/business-proposal.html' | relative_url }}) for detailed requirements and grading criteria.

## Presentation Tips

- **Lead with the problem.** Make the audience feel the friction before you present the solution.
- **Be specific and quantitative.** "SMB payments fees are 20x higher than enterprise" is more compelling than "fees are too high."
- **Anticipate tough questions.** Why hasn't someone already done this? What's the regulatory risk? How do you acquire customers cheaply?
- **Practice.** Rehearse timing — 15 minutes goes fast.

## Assignments Due

- **Group B:** Business Proposal Presentation
- **Final written proposals** for both groups due Finals Week (June 16)
