# Business Proposal Project

## Overview

The Business Proposal is the capstone project of this course, worth 30% of your final grade. Working in your assigned group (A or B), you will identify a financial services industry ripe for disruption, analyze an incumbent firm, and propose a new fintech venture or strategic acquisition that addresses a specific market friction.

The project has three parts, submitted sequentially over the quarter. Each part builds on the last — your industry analysis (Part I) informs your incumbent study (Part II), which grounds your business proposal (Part III).

---

## Part I — Industry Analysis (10%)

**Due:** Week 3 (Group A) / Week 4 (Group B)

**Format:** Five slides. One slide per element below.

### Slide 1: Main Incumbents

Identify the 3–5 dominant firms in your chosen fintech sub-industry. For each, include:
- Market capitalization or AUM (cite source and date)
- Geographic footprint and customer segments served
- Brief description of core product/service

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Goes beyond listing names. Maps the competitive landscape — who competes with whom, where market share is concentrated, and whether the industry is consolidating or fragmenting. Uses a visual (market map, positioning chart, or concentration ratio) to make the structure immediately clear.

**Example:** If analyzing digital payments, you might map Square (now Block), PayPal/Venmo, Stripe, Adyen, and traditional acquirers like Fiserv — showing relative market share in SMB vs. enterprise vs. P2P segments.

### Slide 2: Cost Structure

Break down the major cost categories for firms in this industry:
- Customer acquisition costs (CAC)
- Technology and infrastructure
- Regulatory compliance
- Credit losses or risk-related costs (if applicable)
- Operations and servicing

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Quantifies cost categories as a percentage of revenue using actual company filings (10-K, S-1). Identifies which costs are fixed vs. variable and where fintech entrants have structural cost advantages over incumbents.

**Example:** For digital lending, you might show that a traditional bank's cost-to-originate a small business loan is ~$3,000–$5,000 vs. ~$500 for an online lender, driven by branch overhead and manual underwriting.

### Slide 3: Revenue Model

Describe how firms in this industry generate revenue:
- Fee structures (transaction fees, subscription, interchange, spread)
- Revenue per customer or per transaction
- Revenue growth trajectory

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Includes unit economics — revenue per user, take rate, or net interest margin — with comparisons across 2–3 firms. Shows how revenue models differ between incumbents and fintech challengers.

### Slide 4: Financing Model (Capital Structure)

Explain how firms in this industry are financed:
- Equity vs. debt mix
- Regulatory capital requirements (if applicable)
- Venture funding stage or public market valuation
- Securitization, warehouse lines, or other structured finance (if applicable)

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Connects capital structure to business model constraints. For example, explains why neobanks need bank charters to access cheap deposit funding, or why marketplace lenders rely on securitization to scale.

### Slide 5: Frictions FinTech May Alleviate

Identify the 2–3 most significant frictions in this industry that technology can address:
- Information asymmetries (credit scoring, price transparency)
- Transaction costs (intermediary fees, settlement delays)
- Access barriers (minimum balances, geographic limitations, underserved segments)
- Regulatory frictions (licensing, compliance burden)

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Prioritizes frictions by economic magnitude. Quantifies the size of the friction (e.g., "$X billion in excess fees," "Y million underserved consumers") and ties each friction to a specific technological solution (AI underwriting, blockchain settlement, API banking, etc.).

## Part II — Incumbent Case Study (10%)

**Due:** Week 6 (Group A) / Week 7 (Group B)

**Format:** Five slides. One slide per element below.

### Slide 1: Revenue Model and Market Size

For your chosen incumbent (fintech or traditional finance firm):
- Total revenue and revenue breakdown by segment
- Total addressable market (TAM) and the firm's current market share
- Revenue growth rate and key drivers

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Builds a TAM estimate from the bottom up (number of potential customers x revenue per customer) rather than citing a generic market size number. Shows the firm's trajectory within the market — gaining or losing share, and why.

**Example:** For Wealthfront, you might estimate the robo-advisory TAM as the ~60M U.S. millennials with investable assets x average AUM x advisory fee rate, then compare to Wealthfront's actual AUM and growth.

### Slide 2: Cost Structure

- Detailed cost breakdown from the firm's financial statements
- Key cost ratios (efficiency ratio, CAC, cost-to-serve)
- How costs have evolved as the firm scales

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Benchmarks the firm's cost structure against 1–2 direct competitors. Identifies whether the firm has achieved operating leverage and where cost disadvantages remain.

### Slide 3: Financing Model

- Capital structure (equity, debt, deposits, other)
- Funding sources and cost of capital
- Regulatory capital position (if applicable)
- Recent capital raises or debt issuances

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Connects funding strategy to growth constraints. For example, explains how SoFi's bank charter reduced its cost of funds, or how OnDeck's reliance on warehouse lines created vulnerability during credit downturns.

### Slide 4: Opportunities for Incumbent vs. New Fintech Rival

- Where does the incumbent have defensible advantages? (brand, data, regulatory licenses, distribution, network effects)
- Where is the incumbent vulnerable to fintech disruption?
- What partnerships or acquisitions could strengthen the incumbent?

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Uses a structured framework (e.g., Porter's Five Forces, or a friction-by-friction comparison) rather than listing generic strengths and weaknesses. Cites specific evidence — for example, customer acquisition costs, NPS scores, or technology stack comparisons.

### Slide 5: Risks of Incumbent vs. New Fintech Rival

- Regulatory risks (new rules, enforcement actions, charter requirements)
- Technology risks (legacy systems, cybersecurity, AI adoption)
- Market risks (interest rate sensitivity, credit cycle, competition)
- Execution risks (management, culture, ability to innovate)

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Quantifies risk exposure where possible (e.g., "a 100bp rate increase would reduce net interest margin by X%") and distinguishes between risks that are idiosyncratic to the firm vs. systemic to the industry.

### Helpful Resources for Part II

## Part III — Business Proposal (15%)

**Due:** Presentations in Week 9 (Group A) / Week 10 (Group B). Final written proposal due Finals Week (June 16).

**Format:** 10 slides maximum (5–7 expected), plus title slide and financial statements.

### Title Slide

Company name, tagline, team members, date.

### Slide 1: Main Idea — The Missing Market

Identify a specific, unmet need in financial services:
- What customer segment is underserved or overcharged?
- What friction exists that current firms have failed to solve?
- Why does this gap persist? (regulatory barriers, information asymmetries, misaligned incentives, technological limitations)

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** The missing market is specific and quantifiable — not "improve banking" but "provide automated treasury management for the 6M U.S. small businesses with $100K–$5M in deposits that are too small for commercial bank relationship managers but too large to leave in a zero-interest checking account." Demonstrates that the gap is large enough to build a business around, with evidence from data.

**Example:** A proposal targeting cross-border B2B payments might quantify the $150T global B2B payments market, show that average FX and wire fees are 2–4% for SMBs vs. 0.1% for large corporates, and identify the friction (correspondent banking, manual compliance, batch processing) that technology can eliminate.

### Slide 2: Competitive Analysis — Key Dimensions of Product Space

- Map existing competitors on 2–3 dimensions (e.g., price vs. service level, digital vs. physical, consumer vs. enterprise)
- Show where your venture occupies a distinct position
- Identify direct and indirect competitors

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Uses a well-chosen 2x2 or multi-axis framework where your venture clearly occupies an underserved quadrant. Demonstrates awareness of adjacent competitors who could pivot into your space.

### Slides 3–5: Business Plan — Steps, Timeline, and Data Analysis

- Product description and core value proposition
- Go-to-market strategy (customer acquisition channels, partnerships)
- Technology architecture (build vs. buy, key APIs, data sources)
- Regulatory strategy (licensing, compliance approach)
- Key milestones and timeline (Year 1: launch, Year 2: scale, Year 3: expand)
- Supporting data analysis (market sizing, customer surveys, comparable transaction data)

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Includes quantitative data analysis — not just qualitative assertions. For example, uses public data to estimate customer acquisition costs, models conversion funnels, or analyzes comparable companies' growth trajectories. The timeline is realistic and accounts for regulatory lead times.

### Slides 6–7: Pro Formas and Financing Needs

Provide 3-year projected financial statements:

**Income Statement:**
- Revenue (by stream: transaction fees, subscriptions, interest income, etc.)
- Cost of revenue / cost of goods sold
- Operating expenses (technology, sales & marketing, G&A, compliance)
- EBITDA and net income

**Balance Sheet:**
- Key assets (cash, loans receivable, technology/IP)
- Key liabilities (debt, deposits, deferred revenue)
- Equity (contributed capital, retained earnings)

**Financing Needs:**
- Total capital required and proposed funding sources (equity, debt, revenue)
- Use of proceeds
- Path to profitability or next funding milestone

**What distinguishes an A/A+ submission:** Financial projections are internally consistent (balance sheet balances, cash flow ties to income statement). Assumptions are explicit, reasonable, and benchmarked against comparable companies. Sensitivity analysis shows how results change under different scenarios (e.g., "if CAC is 2x our estimate, breakeven moves from Month 18 to Month 30"). Uses case exhibits from the course as a model for level of detail.

## Using AI Tools for Your Business Proposal

AI tools can significantly accelerate your research, analysis, and presentation quality. You are encouraged to use them — the goal is better analysis, not more tedious work.

### Claude and Claude Code

[Claude](https://claude.ai) is particularly strong for financial research and analysis:

- **Industry research:** Ask Claude to summarize a company's 10-K, compare business models across competitors, or explain regulatory frameworks. Claude can process long documents (up to 1 million tokens) — upload full SEC filings or research papers for analysis.
- **Financial modeling:** Describe your business model assumptions and ask Claude to help build pro forma financial statements, check internal consistency, or run scenario analyses.
- **Data analysis:** Use Claude's code capabilities (via [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or the Analysis tool on claude.ai) to pull data from FRED, clean datasets, create visualizations, or run statistical analyses.
- **Writing, editing, and distilling:** Use Claude to refine slide text, cut dense paragraphs down to their essence, sharpen imprecise language, and ensure consistency across your presentation. AI is excellent not just for *generating* content but for *ruthlessly editing* it. Ask Claude to critique your slides, suggest better visualizations for your data, and pressure-test whether your argument flows logically. The best presentations are not the ones with the most information — they are the ones where every slide makes exactly one clear point.

### Other Helpful AI Tools

- **Perplexity AI** ([perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)) — AI-powered search with source citations; useful for quickly finding recent news, data, and industry reports
- **ChatGPT with Code Interpreter** — upload spreadsheets for automated analysis and chart generation
- **GitHub Copilot** — if you are writing code for data analysis (Python, R)
- **Gamma** ([gamma.app](https://gamma.app)) — AI-assisted presentation design

### Best Practices for AI-Assisted Work

1. **Verify everything.** AI tools can hallucinate facts, citations, and data. Always verify key claims against primary sources (SEC filings, official data, published research).
2. **Use AI to go deeper, not to cut corners.** The best proposals will use AI to do *more* quantitative analysis than would otherwise be feasible — not to generate generic summaries.
3. **Cite your sources.** Whether you found a data point through AI search or manual research, always cite the original source.
4. **Iterate.** Use AI as a thinking partner — share your draft, ask for critique, then revise. The best results come from multiple rounds of refinement.

## Grading Summary

| Component | Weight | Key Criteria |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Part I — Industry Analysis | 10% | Accuracy, quantitative depth, clarity of friction identification, clean visual presentation |
| Part II — Incumbent Case Study | 10% | Quality of financial analysis, competitive insight, risk assessment, concise and precise communication |
| Part III — Business Proposal | 15% | Originality and creativity of the missing market idea, feasibility of business plan, rigor of financial projections, persuasiveness of presentation |

**What separates A/A+ work across all parts:**
- **Quantitative rigor** — claims backed by data, not assertion
- **Specificity** — concrete numbers, named competitors, cited sources
- **Internal consistency** — financials that tie together, a narrative that builds logically from Part I through Part III
- **Creativity and originality** — a genuinely novel idea or a surprising insight about an industry, not a restatement of obvious trends. The best proposals identify opportunities that are non-obvious but well-supported by evidence.
- **Communication quality** — clean, concise slides with well-chosen graphics that convey information at a glance. Every word and visual should earn its place. Avoid dense text blocks — if a chart can replace a paragraph, use the chart. Slide titles should state the takeaway, not the topic (e.g., "SMB payments fees are 20x higher than enterprise" not "Fee analysis").
- **Intellectual ambition** — demonstrates genuine insight about the industry rather than summarizing obvious points
- **Professional polish** — no typos, consistent formatting, clear labeling on all charts and tables
