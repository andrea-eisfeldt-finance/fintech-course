## About the Course

Technology is reshaping every corner of financial services — from how consumers borrow and invest, to how banks manage risk, to how assets are issued, traded, and settled. This course examines that transformation through the lens of economics and finance, asking: *Where does technology create genuine value, and where is it hype?*

Each week combines real-world case studies with academic research and current industry data. Students analyze financial and technology companies — JPMorgan Chase, SoFi, OnDeck, Wealthfront — and apply frameworks from corporate finance, banking, and market microstructure to evaluate fintech business models, identify market frictions, and assess competitive dynamics.

The course culminates in a capstone [Business Proposal]({% link business-proposal.md %}) where student teams identify an unmet need in financial services and build a fintech venture from scratch, including competitive analysis, pro forma financials, and a live pitch.

## Course Themes

1. **New approaches to old problems** — Fintech firms attack structural frictions in financial services: information asymmetries, high transaction costs, access barriers, and regulatory complexity. Technology doesn't automatically solve these — understanding *why* frictions persist is essential to evaluating whether a fintech solution will work.

2. **Value creation on the right-hand side of the balance sheet** — Traditional finance focuses on asset selection. Many fintech innovations create value through novel *funding* models: securitization, deposit-taking via bank charters, tokenization, and marketplace lending.

3. **Regulation as a diseconomy of scale** — For large banks, regulation is a significant cost that creates openings for smaller, less-regulated fintech entrants. But as fintechs scale, they increasingly face the same regulatory burden — sometimes choosing to become banks themselves.

4. **Data is the key** — The firms that win in fintech are the ones that use proprietary data to underwrite risk, personalize products, and reduce costs. AI and machine learning are accelerating this advantage.

5. **AI as accelerant** — Generative AI is reshaping every fintech vertical, from credit underwriting to wealth management to compliance. This course integrates AI throughout — both as a subject of study and as a tool students use for research and analysis.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Construct and interpret book value and market value balance sheets for financial institutions
- Identify frictions in traditional finance and evaluate whether technology solutions address them
- Analyze fintech business models using unit economics, cost structure, and competitive positioning
- Understand blockchain technology, crypto asset trading, stablecoins, and tokenization
- Assess the impact of AI and generative AI on financial services firms and their valuations
- Build a data-driven business proposal for a fintech venture

## Using AI in This Course

Students are encouraged to use AI tools — Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and others — to deepen their analysis. AI should make your work *more quantitative and more rigorous*, not shorter or more generic. Use AI to pull and analyze public data (FRED, SEC EDGAR, FDIC), build financial models, create visualizations, and pressure-test your arguments. Always verify AI-generated facts against primary sources. See the [Business Proposal]({% link business-proposal.md %}) page for detailed guidance.
